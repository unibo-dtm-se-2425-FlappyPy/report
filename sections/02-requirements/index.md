# Requirements

## User Stories

FlappyPy serves multiple user archetypes with distinct motivations and interaction patterns. **Casual gamers** seek immediate entertainment through simple, engaging gameplay that requires minimal setup and provides quick satisfaction during breaks. They value responsive controls and smooth performance over complex features.

**Python developers and students** approach FlappyPy as an educational resource, examining well-structured code to understand pygame development practices, object-oriented design principles, and professional testing methodologies. **Educators** leverage the complete software development lifecycle demonstration to teach students industry-standard practices including Test-Driven Development, CI/CD pipelines, and comprehensive documentation.

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements

The core functionality revolves around six essential requirement categories that collectively deliver the complete gaming experience. **Game Launch and Initialization (FR1)** establishes the foundation through command-line interface accessibility via `python -m FlappyPy`, window initialization with specified dimensions, and stable frame rate management.

**FR2: Bird Movement Control**
- Spacebar input applies upward velocity to the bird
- Continuous gravity causes downward acceleration

**FR3: Obstacle Generation and Movement** encompasses the dynamic challenge system where pipe obstacles generate at regular intervals with randomized gap positions, creating varied gameplay experiences while maintaining consistent horizontal movement speed from right to left.

**FR4: Collision Detection and FR5: Game State Management** work in tandem to handle game boundaries and state transitions, detecting collisions between bird and obstacles or boundaries, triggering appropriate game over states, and providing seamless restart functionality that resets all game objects to initial positions.

**FR6: Scoring System** delivers player progression feedback through point incrementation when successfully passing pipe gaps, continuous score display during gameplay, and accurate score maintenance throughout game sessions with proper reset functionality.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance and Usability** form the backbone of user experience expectations. The system maintains smooth 60 FPS gameplay during normal operation while handling obstacle generation without frame rate drops and completing collision detection within acceptable response times. User interaction remains intentionally simple, requiring only spacebar input for all gameplay interactions while providing immediate visual feedback for player actions.

**Reliability and Portability** ensure broad accessibility across computing environments. The application operates without crashes during extended gameplay sessions and executes seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems, requiring only Python 3.9+ and pygame library dependencies.

### Implementation Requirements

The technical foundation leverages **Python 3.9 or higher** as the primary programming language, utilizing **pygame library** for graphics rendering and input handling, while incorporating **Python's unittest framework** for comprehensive testing coverage that supports the established 55+ tests across 9 modules mentioned in project documentation.

## Essential Terminology

The game architecture revolves around several core concepts that define the interactive experience. The **Bird** represents the player-controlled sprite responding to spacebar input with upward movement while experiencing continuous gravity effects. **Collision Detection** determines sprite intersection with pipe obstacles or screen boundaries, triggering appropriate game state transitions.

The **Game Loop** maintains the continuous cycle of input processing, state updates, and screen rendering at a stable frame rate, while **Pipe Obstacles** create the primary challenge through horizontally moving rectangular barriers with randomized gap positions. The **Scoring** system provides progression feedback by incrementing points when the bird successfully navigates through pipe gaps.

## Acceptance Criteria Summary

**Core Functionality Validation:**
- Game window initialization within 2 seconds at 400x600 pixel resolution
- Bird positioning at default coordinates (x=50, y=300) with 60 FPS stability
- Spacebar input applying immediate upward velocity (-8 pixels/frame)
- Gravity providing consistent downward acceleration (+0.5 pixels/frameÂ²)

**Gameplay Mechanics Verification:**
Pipe generation occurs every 2 seconds (120 frames at 60 FPS) with randomized gap positioning and consistent 3 pixels/frame movement speed. Collision detection triggers within 1 frame of sprite overlap, accurately distinguishing between top pipe, bottom pipe, and ground collisions while properly handling ceiling collisions without game termination.

**Scoring System Accuracy:**
Score incrementation occurs exactly once when the bird's center passes the vertical center line of each pipe pair, with clear display rendering throughout gameplay and accurate calculation during extended sessions, plus immediate reset to zero upon game restart.
