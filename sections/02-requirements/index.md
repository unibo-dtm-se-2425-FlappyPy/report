## User Stories

### Primary Personas

**Casual Gamer (Emma)**
- As a casual gamer, I want to play a simple, engaging game during short breaks so that I can have quick entertainment without complex setup.
- As a casual gamer, I want the game to start immediately when I launch it so that I don't waste time on menus or configuration.
- As a casual gamer, I want to restart the game instantly after collision so that I can try again without interruption.

**Python Developer (Alex)**
- As a Python developer, I want to examine well-structured game code so that I can learn pygame development practices.
- As a Python developer, I want to run comprehensive tests so that I can understand professional testing methodologies.
- As a Python developer, I want to install the game via pip so that I can quickly access and study the implementation.

**Educator (Dr. Chen)**
- As an educator, I want to demonstrate complete software development lifecycle so that I can teach students professional practices.
- As an educator, I want to show real-world Python packaging so that students understand distribution mechanisms.
- As an educator, I want to access comprehensive documentation so that I can explain design decisions to students.

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements

**FR1: Game Launch and Initialization**
- The system shall provide a command-line interface for launching the game via `python -m FlappyPy`
- The system shall initialize a game window with specified dimensions and frame rate
- The system shall display the game area with a bird sprite ready for player interaction

**FR2: Bird Movement Control**
- The system shall respond to spacebar input by applying upward velocity to the bird
- The system shall continuously apply gravity to the bird, causing downward acceleration
- The system shall update bird position based on current velocity each frame

**FR3: Obstacle Generation and Movement**
- The system shall generate pipe obstacles at regular intervals
- The system shall create randomized gap positions for each pipe pair
- The system shall move all pipes horizontally from right to left at consistent speed
- The system shall remove pipes that have moved off-screen to maintain performance

**FR4: Collision Detection**
- The system shall detect collisions between bird and pipe obstacles
- The system shall detect collisions between bird and ground boundary
- The system shall detect collisions between bird and ceiling boundary
- The system shall trigger game over state upon any collision

**FR5: Game State Management**
- The system shall maintain active gameplay state during normal play
- The system shall transition to game over state upon collision detection
- The system shall provide restart functionality via spacebar when in game over state
- The system shall reset all game objects to initial positions upon restart

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1: Performance**
- The system shall maintain smooth 60 FPS gameplay during normal operation

### Implementation Requirements

**IR1: Programming Language**
- The system shall be implemented in Python 3.8 or higher
- **Justification**: Educational requirement for Python-based coursework and widespread accessibility

**IR2: Graphics Library**
- The system shall use pygame library for graphics rendering and input handling
- **Justification**: Industry-standard library for Python game development with extensive documentation and community support

**IR3: Testing Framework**
- The system shall include comprehensive unit tests using Python's unittest framework
- **Justification**: Professional development practice requirement and automated CI/CD pipeline compatibility

**IR4: Package Distribution**
- The system shall be packaged for PyPI distribution using setuptools
- **Justification**: Professional deployment requirement and accessibility for educational use

## Glossary

**Bird**: The player-controlled sprite that responds to spacebar input with upward movement and experiences continuous gravity

**Collision Detection**: The process of determining when the bird sprite intersects with pipe obstacles or screen boundaries

**Frame Rate**: The frequency at which the game updates graphics and physics, measured in frames per second (FPS)

**Game Loop**: The continuous cycle of input processing, game state updates, and screen rendering

**Game Over State**: The non-interactive state triggered by collision, where only restart input is accepted

**Gravity**: The constant downward acceleration applied to the bird sprite each frame

**Pipe Obstacles**: Rectangular barriers that move horizontally across the screen with randomized gap positions

**Sprite**: A game object with position, dimensions, and visual representation

**Velocity**: The rate of change of the bird's position, modified by gravity and player input

## Acceptance Criteria
