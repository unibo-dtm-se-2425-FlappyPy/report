## Product Type

FlappyPy is a **desktop application** developed as a complete Python implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game. The product falls into the category of:

- **Interactive Desktop Game Application** - A standalone executable game with real-time graphics and user input
- **Educational Software Package** - Demonstrates professional Python game development practices
- **Installable Python Package** - Distributed via PyPI for easy installation and execution

The application utilizes the pygame library for graphics rendering, input handling, and game loop management, creating a smooth 60 FPS gaming experience on desktop platforms.

## Use Case Collection

### User Demographics and Context
