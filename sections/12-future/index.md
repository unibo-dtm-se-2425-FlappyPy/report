# Future Development

## Current State and Vision

FlappyPy v1.2.1 represents a **mature educational software project** showcasing comprehensive scoring systems developed through TDD methodology, Python 3.9 compatibility with version-aware asset loading, and robust testing architecture spanning 55+ tests across 9 modules with automated GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, establishing a solid foundation for continued development and learning enhancement.

**Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Persistent high score storage for session continuity
- Professional start screen with integrated instructions
- Advanced game modes and difficulty progression
- Performance optimization and enhanced accessibility features

## Development Strategy

**Strategic progression** prioritizes user experience enhancements through JSON-based high score persistence and professional start screen implementation in version 1.3.0, followed by advanced feature expansion including multiple game modes and potential multiplayer capabilities in version 2.0.0, maintaining the educational project's core mission while demonstrating scalable software architecture and continued professional development practices.

The roadmap balances immediate accessibility improvements with long-term feature expansion, ensuring continued learning value while preserving the comprehensive testing framework and automated GitHub releases that establish FlappyPy as an exemplary educational software engineering project.
