### Game Design Issues

**Collision Detection Edge Cases**
- **Issue**: Very fast bird movement might skip collision detection
- **Symptoms**: Rare instances of bird passing through pipes
- **Impact**: Unfair gameplay and player frustration
- **Root Cause**: Frame-based collision detection without interpolation
- **Solution**: Implement continuous collision detection or smaller time steps

**Physics Realism**
- **Issue**: Physics constants not fine-tuned for optimal gameplay feel
- **Symptoms**: Bird movement might feel too floaty or too heavy
- **Impact**: Suboptimal gameplay experience
- **Root Cause**: No playtesting or physics parameter optimization
- **Solution**: Extensive playtesting and physics parameter adjustment

### User Experience Gaps

**Accessibility Features**
- **Issue**: No accessibility considerations for different user needs
- **Symptoms**: Difficult for users with disabilities to enjoy the game
- **Impact**: Limited audience and poor inclusivity
- **Root Cause**: No accessibility requirements or testing
- **Solution**: Implement keyboard alternatives, visual indicators, and accessibility options

**Installation Documentation**
- **Issue**: Limited troubleshooting guidance for installation problems
- **Symptoms**: Users might struggle with pygame installation or Python setup
- **Impact**: Barrier to entry for less technical users
- **Root Cause**: Focus on technical users rather than general audience
- **Solution**: Expanded installation guide with troubleshooting section
