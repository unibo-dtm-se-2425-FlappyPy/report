# Known Issues and Future Work

This section provides an assessment of FlappyPy v1.2.1's current state and outlines potential improvements for future development.

## Current Implementation Status

**Completed Features (v1.0.0 - v1.2.1)**
- Comprehensive scoring system with TDD approach and real-time tracking
- Animated bird with falling/flying states and background music
- Sound effects and game over audio
- Python 3.9 compatibility with version-aware asset loading
- 55+ tests across 9 modules with automated CI/CD pipeline

## What is Missing

### Core Features Still Needed
- **Persistent High Scores**: Local storage for best scores between sessions
- **Start Screen**: Professional menu system with instructions and controls
- **Visual Polish**: Enhanced graphics and animations beyond basic implementation

### Advanced Features

- **Multiple Game Modes**: Different difficulty levels and game variations
- **Accessibility Features**: Keyboard alternatives and visual indicators

## Technical Improvements Needed

### Performance and Reliability
- **Performance Monitoring**: No profiling or optimization for extended gameplay
- **Error Handling**: Limited exception management for edge cases

### Code Quality
- **Physics Tuning**: Game feel optimization through playtesting

## Future Development Roadmap

### Version 1.3.0 - User Experience
- **High Score Persistence**: JSON file storage for best scores
- **Start Screen**: Welcome screen with instructions and controls

### Version 2.0.0 - Advanced Features
- **Multiple Game Modes**: Different difficulty levels and variations
- **Multiplayer Support**: Local or online competitive features

## Development Priorities

**Immediate**
1. High score persistence and start screen implementation
2. Enhanced visual design and accessibility features

**Long-term**
1. Multiple game modes and advanced features
2. Community features and social integration

## Conclusion

FlappyPy has evolved from v1.0.0 to v1.2.1 with significant improvements including scoring system, sound effects, and Python 3.9 compatibility. The project demonstrates solid software engineering practices with 55+ tests across 9 modules and automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub releases.
