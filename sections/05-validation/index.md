# Validation

## Testing Approach

**Testing Framework: unittest**

- **Python's built-in unittest framework** - No external dependencies required.
- **Standard testing patterns** - Uses familiar TestCase class inheritance.
- **Comprehensive assertions** - Rich assertion methods for validation.
- **Educational value** - Clear, readable test structure for learning purposes.
- **Test coverage** - All functionality validated through comprehensive test suites regardless of development approach.
- **Requirements traceability** - Each test directly validates specific functional requirements.
- **TDD for scoring components** - Scoring system developed with test-first methodology for precision.
- **Post-implementation validation** - Core game mechanics thoroughly tested after implementation.
- **Continuous integration** - All components validated through automated testing pipeline.

## Testing

### Unit Testing

**Test Suite: 55+ Unit Tests Across 9 Test Modules**

| Test Module | Tests | Coverage | Related Requirements |
|-------------|-------|----------|---------------------|
| `test_foundation.py` | 6 tests | Game setup, constants | FR1: Game Launch |
| `test_bird.py` | 4 tests | Bird physics, movement | FR2: Bird Movement |
| `test_physics.py` | 7 tests | Gravity, velocity mechanics | FR2: Bird Movement |
| `test_boundary.py` | 8 tests | Screen edge collision | FR4: Collision Detection |
| `test_pipe.py` | 8 tests | Obstacle generation | FR3: Obstacle Generation |
| `test_collision.py` | 9 tests | Game state, collision logic | FR4, FR5: Collision & State |
| `test_score_display.py` | 4 tests | Score rendering, UI display | FR6: Score Display |
| `test_game_over_display.py` | 3 tests | Game over screen, UI state | FR5: Game State Management |
| `test_scoring.py` | 6 tests | Score calculation, increment logic | FR6: Score System |

**Unit Test Rationale:**
- **Isolated component testing** - Each class and method tested independently.
- **Edge case coverage** - Boundary conditions and error scenarios validated.
- **Physics accuracy** - Mathematical calculations verified with precise assertions.
- **State consistency** - Object states validated before and after operations.
- **Success Rate** - All 55+ tests pass consistently.

### Integration Testing

**Component Integration Tests:**

**Bird + Physics Integration:**
- **Test rationale**: Verify gravity and velocity work together correctly.
- **Components tested**: Bird class with physics constants and update methods.
- **Validation**: Bird movement follows realistic physics over multiple frames.

**Collision Detection Integration:**
- **Test rationale**: Ensure collision system works with Bird and Pipe objects.
- **Components tested**: Bird collision methods with Pipe geometry.
- **Validation**: Accurate collision detection for all pipe parts and boundaries.

**Scoring System Integration:**
- **Test rationale**: Ensure scoring logic integrates correctly with pipe collision and display components.
- **Components tested**: Score calculation, score display rendering, and pipe passage detection.
- **Validation**: Score increments accurately when bird passes through pipes and displays correctly on screen.

**Game State + Input Integration:**
- **Test rationale**: Verify input handling changes behavior based on game state.
- **Components tested**: Game state management with input processing.
- **Validation**: Spacebar produces different behavior during play vs. game over.

### System Testing

**End-to-End Game Flow Testing:**

**Complete Gameplay Cycle Test:**
- **Test plan**: Simulate full game session from start to game over to restart
- **Validation criteria**: 
  - Game initializes correctly with all objects in start positions
  - Bird responds to input with correct physics simulation
  - Pipes generate and move at specified intervals
  - Scoring system increments correctly when bird passes through pipes
  - Score display updates accurately and remains visible throughout gameplay
  - Collision detection triggers game over at appropriate moments
  - Restart functionality resets all game state correctly including score reset

**Cross-Platform Compatibility Testing:**
- **Automated via GitHub Actions CI/CD**
- **Test environments**: Windows, macOS, Linux.
- **Python versions**: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- **Test execution**: Complete test suite runs on all combinations.

**GitHub Actions Integration:**
- **Automatic testing** on every commit and pull request.
- **Multi-environment validation** ensures consistent behavior.

## Acceptance Tests

**User Experience Validation:**

**Test Plan: Core Gameplay Experience**
1. **Launch game** via `python -m FlappyPy`.
2. **Verify immediate responsiveness** - spacebar input should cause immediate bird movement.
3. **Play for 30 seconds** - experience natural game rhythm and challenge.
4. **Intentionally collide with pipe** - game over should trigger immediately.
5. **Restart game** - spacebar should reset everything and allow continued play.

**Test Plan: Installation and Setup**
1. **Verify dependencies** - pygame should install automatically through requirement txt file.
2. **Launch from command line** - game should start immediately without configuration.
3. **Cross-platform testing** - same experience on Windows, macOS, Linux.
