# **FlappyPy**
A Python implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game built with pygame.

Author: [Nima Boubanian](mailto:nima.boubanian@studio.unibo.it)

## Abstract

FlappyPy represents a **educational software engineering project** that transforms the classic Flappy Bird gaming experience into a professional Python 3.9+ implementation showcasing industry-standard development practices. The project demonstrates complete software development lifecycle execution from initial concept through GitHub release deployment, featuring physics-based gameplay mechanics, collision detection systems, and automated testing architecture spanning 55+ tests across 9 modules.

The technical implementation embraces **object-oriented programming principles** with clean architecture separating concerns across Bird physics, Pipe generation, collision detection, and scoring systems. The scoring component uniquely demonstrates Test-Driven Development methodology for educational value, while the broader system employs conventional development practices with comprehensive post-implementation testing validation.

**Professional deployment practices** include automated GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines that validate code quality across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms with Python 3.9-3.11 compatibility before creating GitHub releases with Apache 2.0 licensing. The educational-focused distribution strategy prioritizes accessibility and learning value while demonstrating industry-standard version control, semantic versioning, and quality assurance methodologies essential for software engineering education.
