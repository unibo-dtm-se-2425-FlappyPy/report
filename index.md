# FlappyPy: A Complete Python Game Implementation

### Authors

## Abstract

FlappyPy is a complete Python implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game, developed using pygame and following professional software engineering practices. The project demonstrates a comprehensive development workflow from initial concept through production deployment, featuring physics-based gameplay mechanics, collision detection systems, and automated testing.

The game includes core Flappy Bird mechanics: gravity-based bird movement, procedural pipe generation, collision detection for both pipes and ground boundaries, and game over/restart functionality. The technical implementation showcases object-oriented programming principles, comprehensive unit testing (44+ tests), and professional deployment practices including automated CI/CD pipelines and PyPI package distribution.

Built following test-driven development methodologies, FlappyPy achieved complete feature coverage through systematic incremental development. The project culminated in a production-ready v1.0.0 release, demonstrating the full software development lifecycle from conception to public distribution. The implementation serves as both an engaging game and a showcase of modern Python development practices.
