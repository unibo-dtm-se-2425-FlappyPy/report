### Author

- [Nima Boubanian](mailto:nima.boubanian@studio.unibo.it)

## Abstract

FlappyPy represents a **comprehensive educational software engineering project** that transforms the classic Flappy Bird gaming experience into a professional Python 3.9+ implementation showcasing industry-standard development practices. The project demonstrates complete software development lifecycle execution from initial concept through GitHub release deployment, featuring physics-based gameplay mechanics, comprehensive collision detection systems, and automated testing architecture spanning 55+ tests across 9 modules.

The technical implementation embraces **object-oriented programming principles** with clean architecture separating concerns across Bird physics, Pipe generation, collision detection, and scoring systems. The scoring component uniquely demonstrates Test-Driven Development methodology for educational value, while the broader system employs conventional development practices with comprehensive post-implementation testing validation.
